# STEP 4 - CREATE YOUR URLS FOR YOUR VIEWS
# When somebody requests a page from your website, Django will load the projectFolder_eCommerceApp.urls Python module because itâ€™s pointed to by the ROOT_URLCONF setting.
# It finds the variable named urlpatterns and traverses the patterns in order.

from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    # CUSTOMER MODEL
    path('', views.profile, name='profile'),
    path('users/', views.users, name='users'),
    # PRODUCT MODEL
    path('store/', views.store, name='store'),
    # ORDER MODEL
    path('order/', views.order, name='order')
